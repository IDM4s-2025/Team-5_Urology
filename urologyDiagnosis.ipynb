    "| 1  | Urinary Tract Infection (UTI)      | An infection in any part of the urinary system including the kidneys, ureters, bladder and urethra. |\n",
    "| 2  | Kidney Stones                      | Hard objects made of minerals and salts in urine that form inside the kidneys. |\n",
    "| 3  | Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) |  Most common prostate problem among males that causes your prostate to increase in size. | \n",
    "| 4  | Bladder Cancer                     |Malignant growth in the bladder lining.One of the main causes of bladder cancer is smoking. | \n",
    "| 5  | Hydrocele                          |Is a type of scrotal discharge. This discharge occurs when fluid accumulates in the thin sac surrounding a testicle. | \n",
    "| 6  | Epididymitis                       |Is where a tube behind the testicles becomes swollen and painful. It's often caused by an infection. | \n",
    "| 7  | Pyelonephritis                     |Acute pyelonephritis is a bacterial infection causing inflammation of the kidneys, is generally a complication of an ascending urinary tract infection that spreads from the bladder to the kidneys.| \n",
    "| 8  | Interstitial Cystitis              |Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome is a complex and chronic medical condition that primarily affects the urinary bladder. |\n",
    "| 9  | Prostatitis                        | A group of conditions that includes acute and chronic bacterial prostatitis and chronic pelvic pain syndrome. It can cause infection, inflammation and pain in the prostate gland. | \n",
    "| 10 | Renal Cancer                       | Renal cancer originates from an abnormal proliferation of cells in the kidney tissue. Generally, this type of cancer is diagnosed in early stages, when it is still located within the organ and has not invaded other structures.                                                                       |\n",
    "| 11 | Neurogenic Bladder                 |Neurogenic bladder occurs when something disrupts communication between the brain and the bladder. It can be an injury or a disease. Although it cannot be reversed, it is treatable. With medication, catheters or adjustments in daily routine, it is possible to regain some stability and quality of life.                                                                             | \n",
    "| 12 | Varicocele                         |Varicocele is, in essence, a circulation problem: the veins of the scrotum dilate because the blood does not flow out as it should, and instead of flowing, it becomes trapped. What should be an efficient system becomes clumsy, generating pressure and discomfort in an area that normally goes unnoticed.                                                                            | \n",
